This is Ege, grading your A1. My comments come after the info on correctness.

Starting correctness testing of A1, PhD.

Testing assertions for all preconditions.
Calling isYoungerThan with parameter p null did not cause an AssertionError
End of test of assertions for preconditions: 4 out of 5

Testing constructor 1 and getters.
End test of first constructor and getters: 11 out of 11 pts.

Testing two setter methods.
End test of setter methods: 14 out of 14 pts.

Testing constructor 2.
End test of second constructor: 5 out of 5 pts.

Testing constructor 3.
End test of second constructor: 6 out of 6 pts.

Testing comparison methods.
newPhD3.isPhDSibling(null) gave null-pointer exception.
isPhDSibling errors: 1. Points: 6 out of 7

isYoungerThan errors: 0. Points: 7 out of 7

=================================================

Below, "CheckList" refers to the checklist in part 7 of the A1 handout. pp. 5..6.

26. Deduction 0. You use keyword "this". unnecessarily. Don't put in unnecessary noise. Keep things as   simple as possible.


Correctness                                            53 out of  55
(a) Lines short enough, blanks before methods:         05 out of  05
(b) Class invariant:                                   10 out of  10
(c) Method names, parameters:                          05 out of  05
(d) Specifications complete, used Javadoc comments:    10 out of  10

(f) Checked javadoc:                                   05 out of  05
(g) Testing methods:                                   10 out of  10
